### Computer Networks Project

TCP, UDP, and ICMP are all important protocols used for communication over the internet. The purpose of this project was to gain greater understanding of how these protocols work as well as being able to implement these protocols. This project is currently marked as complete due to it's functionality being completed.

### Getting Started
This code was implemented in C++ through Visual Studio Code. The implementation was done in the Oracle VM virtual box by creating two different namespaces and sending messages from one namespace to the other over the school network. Two separate codes imitating a client and server were created, both sending messages to eachothers assigned sockets. Both namespaces have to be created as well as both codes needing to be run, in which the prompts for messages will show how to continue the conversation.
